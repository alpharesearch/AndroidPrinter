Food Portion Printer

Send food portion information to a mini thermal receipt printer

You will need a mini thermal receipt printer that is connected to your network, I have an open source project that uses an ESP8266 and a mini thermal receipt printer that can do the job, The idea for this app is to be able to create little labels that can be used to add portion information to food that is cooked in bulk. You need to enter the total measurement and the unit and the how many portions additional you many add a comment too. Now you can press the print button and you get a little label with how many units a portion is and all the other important information.
